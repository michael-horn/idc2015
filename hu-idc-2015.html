   <p>
      We present the design and evaluation of an interactive storybook to support
      emerging computational literacy skills for preschool and early elementary school
      children. We structured our designs to take advantage of existing language
      literacy practices between parents and children around the cultural form of a
      children's storybook. We evaluated our design with 14 families from two distinct
      cultural backgrounds: families from the United States Midwest and families from
      Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Our findings describe ways in which parents support
      and structure children's programming activities, and how parental
      involvement varied across the two groups.

   <h1>Introduction</h1>
   <p>
      Developing a computationally literate citizenry is seen as an increasingly
      important goal of modern society [<cite ref="bers-2008"></cite>,
      <cite ref="disessa-2000"></cite>, <cite ref="papert-1980"></cite>,
      <cite ref="resnick-2007"></cite>]. In this paper, we present the
      design and evaluation of a storybook intended to support computational
      literacy skills for preschool and early elementary school children. The
      technology combines a paper storybook with computer programming activities
      that children complete by adhering stickers to the pages of the book
      (Figures 1-6). The programs then control an interactive digital character
      that appears on the screen of a smartphone or tablet computer. 
   </p>
   <p>
      In many parts of the world, parents and young children read storybooks
      together [<cite ref="anderson-2010"></cite>, <cite ref="bus-2000"></cite>,
      <cite ref="senechal-2006"></cite>]. Such family reading activities have been shown to
      promote early literacy skills, reading achievement in elementary school,
      and positive attitudes towards books in general [<cite ref="bus-1995"></cite>,
      <cite ref="senechal-2006"></cite>]. One of the reasons we chose to embed
      computational literacy activities in a storybook has to do with the
      support that parents provide to children when they read together.
      These support
      <div style="width: 3in; height: 1.2in;"></div>

      activities include making spontaneous connections between
      the text of the book and the world of the child; providing emotional
      encouragement; and tailoring the reading session to a child's needs and
      abilities [<cite ref="bus-2000"></cite>,
      <cite ref="bus-1995"></cite>,
      <cite ref="chang-2011"></cite>,
      <cite ref="raffle-2010"></cite>,
      <cite ref="raffle-2011"></cite>]. Through the
      use of a storybook, we hope to cue these valuable language literacy
      practices and to provide a framework for parents to scaffold their
      children's emerging computational literacy skills. We intentionally chose
      to use a paper sticker book (rather than an electronic book) because we
      believe that a physical book presents a <i>cultural form</i> that is less
      ambiguous to parents than an app on a tablet computer. We discuss this
      hypothesis and the role of cultural forms in design below.
   </p>
   <p>
      Storybook reading is also a cultural phenomenon, with practices varying
      from parent to parent, household to household, and region to region.
      Some families view storybook reading as a pleasurable activity, while
      others might think of it as more of an opportunity to teach literacy
      skills or to impart important life lessons [<cite
      ref="anderson-2010"></cite>, <cite ref="bus-2000"></cite>]. In selecting
      a storybook as our source cultural form, we were aware that parental
      activities could vary dramatically from one family to the next. Thus, to
      evaluate our prototype we recruited families from two regions (8 families
      from the U.S. Midwest, and 6 families from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia). In so
      doing, we hoped to understand dimensions along which parental involvement
      might vary and to improve our designs in light of diversity.
   </p>
   <p>
      In this paper we review related work and provide a theoretical background
      for our design. We then describe the design and implementation of our
      prototype. Finally we present an evaluation with parents and children. Our
      findings describe a variety of ways in which parents support their
      children's programming activities.

   <h1>RELATED WORK</h1>
   <p>
      The integration of storytelling, physical materials, and interactive digital
      systems has a rich history in the human-computer interaction literature. One
      strand of research has involved the creation of immersive storytelling
      environments (e.g. [<cite ref="bobick-1999"></cite>,
      <cite ref="montemayor-2004"></cite>]).
      For example, <i>StoryRoom</i> [<cite ref="montemayor-2004"></cite>] is an
      immersive environment in which children can create and "program" their own
      stories using interactive physical elements. To program StoryRoom, children use
      a magic wand to specify the relationships between various interactive story
      props (sensors and actuators). Another strand of research has explored
      children's storytelling through the use of interactive "companions" such
      as stuffed animals and child-friendly robots [<cite ref="bers-2008"></cite>,
      <cite ref="druin-1999"></cite>,
      <cite ref="franckel-2010"></cite>,
      <cite ref="strommen-1998"></cite>,
      <cite ref="umaschi-1997"></cite>]. Some of
      these projects enable children to program elements of the interactive
      companion to endow them with sound, emotional expression, and movement
      [<cite ref="bers-2008"></cite>,
      <cite ref="umaschi-1997"></cite>].
   </p>
   <p>
      Several projects have also explored the use of physical and digital
      storybooks as a context for communication, storytelling, and learning with
      children [<cite ref="chang-2011"></cite>,
      <cite ref="fails-2010"></cite>
      <cite ref="franckel-2010"></cite>,
      <cite ref="follmer-2010"></cite>,
      <cite ref="hengeveld-2009"></cite>,
      <cite ref="raffle-2010"></cite>,
      <cite ref="raffle-2011"></cite>,
      <cite ref="ryokai-2012"></cite>,
      <cite ref="sylla-2012"></cite>]. One relevant example is Sylla et
      al.'s <i>t-books</i> system that combines a physical book with electronic sensors
      [<cite ref="sylla-2012"></cite>]. As children read t-books, they can place
      picture cards into slots in the book to interact with the narrative
      structure. Another project is Chang and Breazeal's <i>TinkRBook</i>, a
      digital storybook that, among other things, allows children to explore
      relationships between text and imagery in a story [<cite ref="chang-2011"></cite>].
      In introducing their system, Chang and Breazeal pose the questions: "What
      if books were 'tinkerable'? What if children could actively explore and
      modify a story, through voice and touch, to dynamically explore meaning as
      conveyed by the relationship of text to illustrated concept?" As part of
      their project, Chang and Breazeal observed families reading together and
      noted the variety of interactions between parents and children that
      enriched the storytelling experience [<cite ref="chang-2011"></cite>].
      <i>StoryFaces</i> is another storybook environment in which children
      record emotional expressions through a digital camera that then become
      part of the storybook's illustrations [<cite ref="ryokai-2012"></cite>]. 
   </p>
   <p>
      Several recent projects have explored the use of storybooks as a context
      to improve remote communication between distributed family members. <i>Video
      Play</i> [<cite ref="follmer-2010"></cite>] is a system through which
      children and long-distance family members act as characters in children's
      storybooks by integrating video chat streams directly into the storybook
      illustrations. <i>Family Story Play</i> [<cite ref="raffle-2010"></cite>]
      and <i>Story Visit</i> [<cite ref="raffle-2011"></cite>] augment video
      conferencing so that remote adult family members can see and hear each
      other while reading the same connected storybook. Analysis of families
      using these systems revealed that many of the common reading enrichments
      that occur between adults and children carried through into the remote
      sessions. Finally, Freed et al. presented the idea of using electronic
      stickers to create personalized remote communication interfaces in <i>I/O
      stickers</i> [<cite ref="freed-2011"></cite>]. Children can attach I/O
      stickers to special greeting cards to invent ways to communicate with
      long-distance loved ones with personalized connected messages. This was
      one of the inspirations for our current stickerbook design.
   </p>
   <p>
      Over the past forty years researchers have created a variety of
      programming environments to introduce computational literacy skills to
      children [<cite ref="druin-1999"></cite>,
      <cite ref="disessa-2000"></cite>,
      <cite ref="horn-2012"></cite>,
      <cite ref="kelleher-2007"></cite>,
      <cite ref="mcnerney-2004"></cite>,
      <cite ref="montemayor-2004"></cite>,
      <cite ref="papert-1980"></cite>,
      <cite ref="sylla-2012"></cite>,
      <cite ref="wyeth-2008"></cite>]. One interesting example that
      combines storytelling and computer programming activities is <i>Storytelling
      Alice</i> [<cite ref="kelleher-2007"></cite>]. Kelleher et al. designed
      this programming environment to engage middle school girls in the creation
      of interactive narratives with 3D virtual characters. Finally, tangible
      programming environments attempt to incorporate playful physical materials
      into the process of creating computer code (e.g. [<cite ref="horn-2012"></cite>,
      <cite ref="mcnerney-2004"></cite>, <cite ref="montemayor-2004"></cite>,
      <cite ref="wyeth-2008"></cite>]). Unlike much of the prior work in tangible
      programming, our stickbook design employs the use of inexpensive materials
      (paper stickers) that lend themselves to mass production and distribution.
   </p>
   <h1>DESIGN PROCESS</h1>
   <p>
      In this project we are attempting to create an informal learning activity
      that supports emerging computational literacy skills in a fun and engaging
      way for preschool and early elementary school children. The activity
      ideally provides a structured introduction to basic computer programming
      skills while at the same time allowing for open-ended exploration.
      Finally, regardless of parents' prior experience with computer programming,
      we hope to encourage productive parental involvement to tailor the
      activity to a child's needs and experience level.

   <h2>Designing from Cultural Forms</h2>
   <p>
      Our design process was guided by the idea of building novel interactive
      systems based on existing <i>cultural forms</i> [<cite ref="horn-2013"></cite>].
      By cultural form, we refer to historically elaborated social constructions
      that are inherently linked to social practices and activities [<cite ref="saxe-1991"></cite>].
      Examples include things like counting systems, games, tools, monetary
      currency, and so on. Cultural forms can involve physical artifacts (as in
      currency systems or games like chess) or they can consist entirely of
      patterns of activity (as in games like hide and seek). For this project,
      we built on two cultural forms: children's storybooks and stickers.
   </p>
   <p>
      The idea of designing from cultural forms was inspired by the notion of
      <i>cultural funds of knowledge</i> [<cite ref="moll-1992"></cite>], Lee's
      <i>cultural modeling design framework</i> [<cite ref="lee-2003"></cite>],
      and Stevens' [<cite ref="stevens-2007"></cite>] ethnographic research on
      children playing video games together in homes. Creating interactive
      systems based on cultural forms has two advantages. First, cultural forms
      are inherently linked to social practices. In other words, an artifact
      like a storybook is nothing more than a few sheets of paper and cardboard
      in the absence of recurrent, socially organized activities that give it
      meaning. A storybook is a storybook because a child knows that she can
      pull it off a shelf at bedtime, sit with it on her mother's lap, and read
      it (or have it read to her). And, of course, the act of reading involves
      far more than decoding symbols on the page and reciting the words out
      loud. Parents and children have elaborate rituals that include making
      spontaneous connections between the text and the world of the child,
      pointing out characters and objects in the illustrations, asking and
      answering questions, providing emotional support, and tailoring the
      reading session to the child's needs and abilities [<cite
      ref="anderson-2010"></cite>,
      <cite ref="bus-2000"></cite>,
      <cite ref="bus-1995"></cite>,
      <cite ref="chang-2011"></cite>]. 
   </p>
   <p>
      This leads to a second advantage, which is that the practices surrounding
      cultural forms involve a variety of social, emotional, and cognitive
      resources. If we can successfully evoke source cultural forms in our
      designs, there is the possibility that users will bring these
      practice-linked resources to bear on the novel activities that our
      interactive system supports (in our case computational literacy
      activities). Even though cultural forms have a degree of historical
      stability, they are also malleable [<cite ref="saxe-1991"></cite>]. People
      continually appropriate and restructure existing forms to serve new
      functions in light of shifting goals and expectations [<cite
      ref="saxe-1991"></cite>], opening the possibility that interaction
      designers can intentionally create transitional forms that maintain
      aspects of the source forms, while, at the same time, supporting novel
      activities (such as computer programming). 
   </p>
   <p>
      A final point is that cultural forms are culturally specific. Forms that
      make sense in one context are not recognized in other contexts, or are not
      recognized in quite the same way. Cultural forms might be more or less
      accessible to different members of the same group depending on factors
      such as age, gender, education, and individual experiences. For example,
      experience in a specific domain (such as computer programming) might
      change the meaning and utility of various forms [<cite
      ref="saxe-1991"></cite>]. For these reasons we thought it was important to
      test our prototype in diverse cultural contexts.
   </p>
   
   <h2>Stickerbook Design</h2>
   <p>
      Thinking about this project from the standpoint of cultural forms helped
      us to identify several possible design directions. The idea of using a
      stickerbook to introduce programming activities was immediately appealing
      because we thought that it provided a rich and recognizable form with
      advantageous practice-linked resources. Specifically, we hoped that the
      storybook form would promote parental involvement in structuring the
      activity. We also assumed that kids would be familiar with stickers and
      would know how to stick them to a sheet of paper. Another appealing aspect
      is that the materials involved are relatively inexpensive and lend
      themselves to mass production and distribution.
   </p>
   <p>
      This project was challenging in that both the narrative structure and the
      supporting technology were untested and needed to be able to function in concert
      to create an engaging and enjoyable experience for parents and children. Based
      on Wyeth [<cite ref="wyeth-2008"></cite>] and Horn et al.'s [<cite
      ref="horn-2012"></cite>] work on programming curriculum for early
      elementary school children, we attempted to introduce a series of powerful
      ideas [<cite ref="bers-2008"></cite>, <cite ref="papert-1980"></cite>]
      from computer programming and robotics through the storybook. Following
      [<cite ref="horn-2012"></cite>] we selected programming activities to
      build on one another conceptually while remaining developmentally
      appropriate for children in our target age range (see Table 1).

      Working with a storybook illustrator we iteratively developed and tested
      several prototypes and storylines over the course of a year. Our current
      prototype follows the story of a lonely boy named Roberto (Omar in our
      Arabic translation) who travels across a city in search of new friends
      (Figure 2). Each encounter between Roberto and the characters in the story
      prompts a programming activity as shown in Figures 2 and 6. As with other
      tangible programming languages, the stickers themselves encode a physical
      syntax that indicates how they can be combined together on the page. For
      example, the BEGIN sticker has an outgoing notch but no incoming notch,
      while the END sticker has an incoming notch, but no outgoing notch (Figure
      3). Likewise, the REPEAT stickers shown in Figure 4 have an angular
      indentation on the top to indicate the location of a parameter sticker. We
      tested several variations of sticker shapes before settling on those shown
      in Figures 3 and 4. The challenge was to find a shape that took up as
      little horizontal space on a page as possible while still allowing room
      for text, an icon, and a TopCode on each sticker. The sticker shapes also
      had to be easy for children to place on the page with reasonable accuracy.

      Dashed sticker outlines on the pages of the book (see Figures 2 and 6)
      indicate the structure of the programs that can be created, as well as the
      types of stickers that can be used. There was a design tradeoff in terms
      of providing enough guidance for parents and children to learn how to
      create programs without getting frustrated while at the same time not
      being overly restrictive in terms of creative expression. In general we
      strove to keep the design as minimal as we could and to avoid textual
      instructions whenever possible. However, based on pilot testing, we found
      it necessary to include two pages of brief instructions at the beginning
      of the book to describe the process of creating and running programs.
      Finally, to revise programs, children can either peel the stickers off the
      page to reuse them, or they can stick a different programming statement
      directly on top of another statement.
   </p>
 
   <h2>Implementation</h2>
   <p>
      The programs that families create are acted out by a digital version of
      Roberto on the screen of a smart phone or tablet computer (Figure 5). To
      translate physical stickers into executable computer code, we adapted the
      technique of Horn et al.'s Tern programming system [<cite
      ref="horn-2012"></cite>]. In particular, each sticker includes a TopCode
      computer vision fiducial that identifies both the type of sticker and its
      placement relative to other stickers on the page (Figures 3 and 4). To
      capture programs digitally, we developed an Android app that uses a mobile
      device's built-in camera to take a photograph of the page. The individual
      TopCodes are then decoded from the digital image and converted into
      assembly instructions. This assembly code is then fed into a runtime
      interpreter that controls an animated version of Roberto that appears on
      the screen of the device (Figure 5). The compile process takes two to
      three seconds depending on the device.
   </p>
   
   <h1>Research Questions</h1>
   <p>
      In evaluating our prototype, we were interested in two questions. First,
      was the storybook cultural form a good starting point for our design? In
      other words, was it effective in cueing parents to provide structure and
      support for their children in the programming activities? We were
      especially interested in how parental practices from storybook reading
      translated into computer programming activities.
   </p>
   <p>
      Second, we developed our stickerbook prototype with the assumption that
      practices surrounding storybook reading would vary dramatically from
      household to household and region to region. Therefore, we were interested
      in the question: Are there cultural differences in the ways in which
      parents support their children? To address this research question, we
      conducted testing with English-speaking families in the United States
      Midwest and Arabic-speaking families in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
   </p>
   
   <h1>Evaluation</h1>
   <p>
      To evaluate our prototype, we recruited caretaker-child dyads through fliers
      and word-of-mouth. The participants dyads read the storybook and completed
      the activities together. Sessions were held either at participant homes or
      at our campus laboratory.

   <h2>Participants</h2>
   <p>
      Eight caretaker-child dyads participated in the study in the United
      States. There were 4 boys and 4 girls, all between the ages of 4 and 10
      (average age 6.63, SD=2.0). All of the families spoke English during the
      study. Six dyads participated in the study in Saudi Arabia. There were 3
      boys and 3 girls between the ages of 4 and 8 (average age 6.0, SD=1.41).
      All families spoke in Arabic during this study. For these families, we
      translated the storybook, stickers, and app to Arabic (Figure 6). We also
      reversed the direction in which programs were assembled (right-to-left
      rather than left-to-right) in order to be consistent with written Arabic.
      All families received a gift certificate worth around $15 USD.
   </p>
   <h2>Methods</h2>
   <p>
      After signing consent forms, we presented participants with the storybook,
      sticker sheets, and a mobile device. We then invited them to read the
      story and do the activities together. If the participants asked the
      researcher for help, we asked them to try to resolve the problem on their
      own. The researchers only intervened when a problem prevented the
      continuation of the activity. All of the sessions were video recorded,
      transcribed, and translated to English for analysis. The transcriptions
      included 2,798 lines spoken by adults. Informed by
      research on storybook reading [<cite ref="anderson-2010"></cite>,
      <cite ref="bus-2000"></cite>,
      <cite ref="bus-1995"></cite>,
      <cite ref="chang-2011"></cite>,
      <cite ref="senechal-2006"></cite>],
      we iteratively developed a coding scheme focused on the parents' role in
      the sessions. We coded all of the sessions using the scheme shown in Table
      2. Two researchers obtained 92.3% agreement on these codes based on 15% of
      the transcripts (Kappa = 0.664).
   </p>
      
   <h1>Findings</h1>
   <h2>Parental Support Activities</h2>
   <p>
      Our first research question involved understanding the ways in which
      parents structured the programming activities to support their children's
      learning. Five broad categories of parental activity emerged from our
      data (shown in Table 2). Technical support refers to identifying and
      helping to operate equipment such as the mobile device, its camera, the
      software, and the stickers (e.g. placing the stickers correctly on the
      page). Task support is more conceptual in nature and focuses on the hows
      and whys of computer programming. This includes drawing connections
      between programming concepts and children's knowledge and prior
      experiences; elaborating components of the programming task; and
      explaining how the programming system worked. Emotional support includes
      offering praise and encouragement; and confirming a child's decisions or
      actions. Finally, lesson-oriented activities involve quizzing children
      about the meaning of the stickers or the text as well as directly
      instructing them to perform certain actions. 
   </p>
   <p>
      Many of the parental support strategies for computational literacy seemed
      closely related to strategies for general language literacy, and it was
      often difficult to distinguish between the two. For example, the following
      excerpt comes from a four-year-old girl and her mother in the United
      States. The pair had just started their first programming activity in the
      book and the mother used the opportunity to help familiarize her daughter
      with the programming stickers.

   <p class="excerpt">
      Mom: So what, what different things can he do in the dance? <br />
      Daughter: Uh, that one, and I mean. That one, and that one, and that one [referring to stickers].<br />
      Mom: What about these?<br />
      Daughter: Well actually, this one.<br />
      Mom: Which one is this? What's the word?<br />
      Daughter: Spin!<br />
      Mom: Spin. So what, if we use this sticker, what will he do? <br />
      Daughter: Uh, spin.<br />
      Mom: This one?<br />
      Daughter: Walk.<br />
      Mom: Walk.<br />
      Mom: [pointing other stickers in turn]<br />
      Daughter: Stand.<br />
      Daughter: Run.<br />
      Daughter: Spin [inaudible] ah ha ha!  <br />
      Mom: That will be a fun one.
   </p>      
   <p>
      The mother begins this excerpt by elaborating on the programming prompt:
      "use the stickers to help Roberto dance". By asking her daughter what
      "different things can he do", she was orienting her daughter to the
      physical materials needed for the programming activity&mdash;in the video she
      had positioned the stickers in front of the storybook and was pointing to
      individual stickers in turn. Throughout the session, the mother positioned
      the various pieces of equipment for her daughter to notice and identify. 
   </p>      
   <p>
      The mother appeared to take advantage of the first activity to not only
      familiarize her daughter with the range of possible programming stickers,
      but also to practice reading skills; the girl at age four was just able to
      read the words on the stickers. The mother pointed to each sticker in turn
      and waited for her daughter to say the word out loud, after which the
      mother repeated the word. And, by asking her daughter to predict the
      effect of stickers ("if we use this sticker, what will [Roberto] do?"), she
      assessed her daughter's understanding of the words on the stickers as well
      as the ways in which the system functioned to control the
      digital character.
   </p>      
   <p>
      At another level, the mother seemed to be emotionally framing the activity
      for her daughter by saying things like, "that will be a fun one". In other
      words, she was setting up the activity as something that would be fun to
      participate in. 
   </p>      
   <p>
      Finally, the mother in this dyad (like many of the parents in our study)
      provided a range of technical support to her daughter. These included
      things like helping her daughter to peel stickers off the sheet, helping
      her hold and position the tablet computer when it was time to take
      pictures of the program, and identifying elements of the user interface
      (such as buttons on the screen) for her daughter to press. Throughout the
      session, the mother seemed to continually reassess her daughter's ability
      to manipulate elements of the system, allowing her to perform the tasks on
      her own when she was capable. Such scaffolding and fading of support was
      commonly cited in research on parents and children reading
      together [<cite ref="anderson-2010"></cite>, <cite ref="bus-2000"></cite>,
      <cite ref="chang-2011"></cite>].
   </p>
   
   <h3>6.1.1 Making Connections</h3>
   <p>
      While reading with children, many parents make connections between
      elements of the story (characters, illustrations, and objects) and the
      world of the child [<cite ref="anderson-2010"></cite>, <cite ref="bus-2000"></cite>,
      <cite ref="chang-2011"></cite>]. In our data, this type of extra-textual
      elaboration often carried over into the programming activities as well.
      For example, one father and his 8-year-old son were working on the second
      programming task together. The boy was a proficient reader, and he quickly
      read the text of the story out loud while the father watched and listened
      mostly in silence, mainly making comments or asking questions about the
      task between the pages of the storybook. As the boy completed the second
      activity, the father called attention to the repeat stickers.
   </p>
   <p class="excerpt">
      Dad: [points to begin repeat and end repeat stickers] What, what does...
      What we're creating here is like on the DJ software that we use and you
      guys create loops.<br />
      Son: [adds stop sticker] Yup. <br />
      Dad: That's a loop. You know that's how we capture the start and the end.
      All right, do your thing. See if you can make it work. 
   </p>
   <p>
      Here the father attempts to draw a parallel between a programming control
      structure (a loop) and another aspect of the child's life that he knows
      his son has experienced.
   </p>
   
   
   <h3>6.1.2 Lesson-Oriented Activities</h3>
   <p>
      Some parents also seemed to use the activity as an opportunity to teach
      language and programming skills to their children. These types of
      interactions were characterized by frequent direct instructions and
      questions about the meaning of the text, images, and programming stickers.
      Parents would also often repeat their child's answers to questions. 
   </p>
   
   
   
   <h2>Cultural Differences</h2>
   <p>
      Our second research question involved understanding differences in the
      stickerbook activity due to cultural differences between families in two
      distinct countries: United States and Saudi Arabia. Prior research
      comparing parent-child reading practices of Dutch, Turkish-Dutch, and
      Surinamese-Dutch families, found cultural differences in the ways in which
      parents supported their children during storybook reading sessions [<cite ref="bus-2000"></cite>]. 
   </p>
   <p>
      As we began to analyze our video, one obvious difference was the degree to
      which Saudi parents questioned the researcher during the sessions. Even
      though we instructed parents to try to figure out the activity on their
      own, Saudi parents asked the researcher an average of 21 questions per
      session compared to 4.13 questions per session from US parents (Figure 7).
      Typical questions involved clarifying the purpose of the activity and
      asking whether or not they were doing things correctly. This suggests that
      the Saudi parents interpreted the purpose of the study differently than US
      parents. 
   </p>

   <figure>
      <img src="figs/idc13-figure7.png" style="width: 3.3in;" />
      <figcaption>

      </figcaption>
   </figure>
   </div>
</div>
<div class="page">
   <div class="columns">
   <p>
      This difference in interpretation seemed to carry over into the
      interactions between parents and children as well. Overall Saudi parents
      made much more frequent use of direct instructions and assistance with the
      stickers than US parents (see Figure 7). They also provided more frequent
      explanations of the programming tasks and system. From these data, it
      appears that the Saudi parents saw the activity as an opportunity to
      offer direct instruction to their children, both in terms of general
      language literacy and computational literacy. For example, this excerpt
      came from a Saudi mother reading with her son (age 8):
   </p>
   <p class="excerpt">
      Mom: Tap... Forever [reading]. Can we use these now? [question directed to researcher]<br />
      Researcher: What do you think?<br />
      Mom: [pasting sticker] ...gets repeated over and over<br />
      Son: Run<br />
      Mom: This is jump here [correcting son]<br />
      Kid: Jump, sleep... so he could get some rest.<br />
      Mom: Okay, what next?<br />
      Kid: Sleep, so he could get some rest.<br />
      Mom: Sleep?!<br />
      Kid: Yes, to get rest!<br />
      Mom: Umm, no. Jump and then directly sleep? I don't think it is appropriate.<br />
      Kid: He plays a lot<br />
      Mom: Yes [laughs]
   </p>
   <p>
      The US parents also treated the stickerbook as an opportunity for learning, but
      the activity seemed more child-directed. For example, US parents asked almost
      twice as many quiz-like questions as Saudi parents (not significant), but they
      also provided less physical assistance to children while at the same time
      offering slightly more emotional support (also not significant). On average US
      parents also spoke less than their Saudi counterparts. There were 204 utterances
      per session average for US parents (SD=115) compared to 309 utterances for Saudi
      parents (SD=33.6); t(12)=2.14, p=0.054. The average session length for Saudi
      families was 
      
      35.12 minutes (SD=4.4)
      
      while the average session length for US familes was
      
      30.74 minutes (SD=8.86).
      
      The difference was not significant. 

   </p>
   <p>
      These results should be interpreted with caution. While the differences
      were significant in many cases, our sample was small, and other factors
      beyond culture and language might have contributed to these results. One
      important factor could have been that the US families were recruited from
      a University campus, while the Saudi families were not. 
   </p>
   <h1>Discussion</h1>
   <p>
      At one level this paper explores new ways to support children's early
      computational literacy. We believe that this is important not only to
      develop the next generation of scientists and engineers, whose professions
      are indisputably more computational than ever before, but also to
      support a computationally literate citizenry (teachers, doctors,
      lawyers, artists, activists) in an increasingly computationally-oriented
      world [<cite ref="bers-2008"></cite>,
      <cite ref="disessa-2000"></cite>,
      <cite ref="papert-1980"></cite>,
      <cite ref="resnick-2007"></cite>,
      <cite ref="wing-2008"></cite>].
   </p>
   <p>
      At another level, this paper explores the idea of designing through
      cultural forms as a way to invoke valuable cognitive, social, and
      emotional resources. In this case we embedded computational literacy
      activities within a children's storybook in a deliberate effort to not
      only encourage parental involvement but also to suggest effective ways for
      them to be involved. Because we work from recognizable cultural forms,
      we hope to facilitate interactions between parents and children that might
      not otherwise occur. And, in this case, our role as designers is to make
      evident the connection between early language literacy and early
      computational literacy.
   </p>
   <p>
      Here the legibility of the cultural form is critical. Imagine that the
      instead of a paper storybook, we had instead created an activity that
      existed entirely on a tablet computer. This would have made the creation
      of programs easier, but might have also obscured the underlying cultural
      form. Plausibly, the tablet computer itself, would become the most salient
      aspect of the activity, a device that can be a video game, an email
      client, a music player, a camera, and so on. The social activity
      structures surrounding the tablet computer are correspondingly diverse,
      but this flexibility could have a downside. As parents and kids engage
      with the device, there is a period of uncertainty and orientation that
      must take place before the familiar form of the storybook begins to
      surface. Powering on the device, fumbling through homes screens, and
      finding the right icon to launch the app. There is also a looming
      possibility that the activity will be interrupted when a child
      accidentally presses the home button and dissolves the storybook world.
      Finally, there is a period of learning that must take place once the
      book/app is launched. This is because the use of an e-book implies a sort
      of metaphorical gulf that parents and children must bridge. In other
      words, a mapping between the experience of reading a physical book and
      interacting with an e-book must be constructed and then mutually agreed
      upon by the parent and child. "Look, this screen is just like the page of
      a book, and sliding a finger is like turning the page."
   </p>   
   <p>
      Our results highlight some of the opportunities and challenges of working
      with paper books. In cases where parents or caregivers were less involved,
      children struggled to make sense of the activity on their own. On the
      other hand, when parents were more actively involved, we observed many
      instances of learning interactions in which parents scaffolded their
      children's understanding of the programming activities. And, while we
      observed differences between US and Saudi parents in the ways in which
      they interpreted and structured the stickerbook activities for their
      children, both supported what seemed to be valuable learning interactions.
   </p>
   
   <h1>Limitations And Future Work</h1>
   <p>
      One limitation of this work is that the sticker/computer vision mechanism
      might be more difficult to use than a purely graphical programming system.
      Another approach might be to offer the programming activities entirely on
      the screen of the mobile device with the storybook as a companion element.
      Or we could create a hybrid environment [<cite ref="horn-2012"></cite>] in
      which kids could program either with stickers or on the screen. These are
      directions we would like to explore in future research. 
   </p>
   <p>
      A second limitation is that despite recruiting participants in two
      countries and two languages, our sample was still narrow and relatively
      affluent. In the future, we might test with a broader range of families
      even within one country to capture a more diverse sample. We would also
      like to include an assessment of learning outcomes to provide quantitative
      data on the effectiveness of this approach in fostering computational
      literacy.

   <h1>CONCLUSION</h1>
   <p>
      In this paper we presented a computational literacy stickerbook. Our goal
      is to create an engaging informal learning experience that introduces
      powerful ideas from computer programming in a somewhat structured format.
      To accomplish this, we adopted the cultural form of a children's
      storybook. The use of the narrative structure of a storybook allowed us to
      arrange the programming activities in a linear sequence of increasing
      complexity. We also expected that storybooks would engage parents in
      helping to structure and support their children's learning. To test these
      ideas, we conducted an evaluation with 14 families from the United States
      and Saudi Arabia. Our findings suggest that parents and children engage in
      a variety of literacy-related activities while reading the book and
      creating programs. Many storybook reading practices seemed to carry over
